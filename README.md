Movie Search
================

Simple movie search made using [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/). All data is fetched using The [OMDb API](http://www.omdbapi.com/). 

Visit https://omdb-react.netlify.app/ for live demo.

Search for your favourite movies with the movie title and get details about them like rating, runtime, cast, director, etc.


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
